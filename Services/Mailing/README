The Mailing service aims at adding additional mailing capabilities to ILIAS-objects.

It brings the following features:

* Have attachments for mails available for the ilias object. Add, remove and view
  and view those attachments.
* Have an overview over all mails that are send automatically for that object. See
  when they will be send, when they were sent the last time. Preview that mails and
  send them to some of the designated recipients manually.
* View a log of the mails that were sent regarding the ilias-object.


Architecture

The central object is the ilMailingGUI-object. It builds the "Mailing"-tab, which
could be attached to an ObjectGUI. The class is abstract to customize its behaviour
for different ILIAS-objects.

It owns objects for managing the automails, the maillog and the attachments, where
subclass can init those objects.

Objects of the ilAutoMails class manage the auto mails, where an auto mail is
represented by an ilAutoMail-object. The automails available for an object can
be determined in a subclass of ilMailingGUI by initializing an appropriate
ilAutoMails-object. ilAutoMails is also responsible for creating instances of
the ilAutoMail-classes it manages.

Objects of the ilMailAttachments class manage the attachments at an object. They
support adding and removing of attachments. You can as well retreive a list of the
available attachments and check, weather a filename is an attachment managed by
the object. To prevent deleting of attachments that are used in some automail
you can lock and unlock an attachment and check, weather a file is locked as well.

Objects of the ilMailLog class are used to log mails occured at a specific object.
They log the complete content and the attachments. To store the logged attachments
an ilMailStorage object is used. That objects store files with a name according
to the md5 hash of the file to not store multiple copies of the same file.


Caveats

This first approach to a generic mailing functionality only supports sending emails
via ilMimeMail. It is not aware of the ILIAS-internal mailing system. It also does not
implement the mail to members tab by itself, since atm it is used for courses, where
a mail to members tab already exists.
